# 👋 Hey, I'm Anthony Alicea / MOGARR

I'm a full-stack web developer and recent graduate of Lighthouse Labs' Web Development Bootcamp. I have a strong foundation in modern web technologies with a growing focus on e-commerce, accessibility, and performance.

Before becoming a developer, I worked as a professional cook — a background that helps me to work under pressure, work well in a team, and constantly improve. The same skills I use to develop full-stack projects by myself or with some amazing people!
